		<p class="guts"> Greetings ! I'm Marithe Ianne D. Gonzales, a *struggling* Pisay Scholar from the section 9 - Pinatubo.<br>
		This is supposed to be our Computer Science 3 Project for the First Quarter, and I guess I passed it late :')<br>
		I'll be better next quarter and definitely improve my time management :DD I don't want to repeat my performance <br>
		for this quarter.<br>
		<br>
		But anyway, I got motivated to tackle this sensitive subject because of a TV Show I love watching, which is Glee.<br>
		A character there, Quinn Fabray, although not very explored much, has a very messy and problematic household.<br>
		Her father gets to decide and have the last say in everything, and it's quite obvious Quinn's mother is scared of him.<br>
		<br>
		I admit, my writing skills aren't the best as well as my coding or HTML skills. But this entire experience<br>
		- of writing the essay, editing it and thinking of words to accurately describe what message I was sending to<br>
		whoever would read it - was deep and it challenged me to ask myself hard or puzzling questions.<br>
		<br>
		And I do hope that, all victims of domestic abuse can either gather enough strength to stand up for themselves,<br>
		or gain supporters who'll no doubt do their best to help in such a particular situation. I really do wish for<br>
		these issues to be more known about, so people will flock and help in whatever way they can and to learn to be wary <br>
		or alert about the red flags or warning signs of domestic violence.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Also, a  v e r y  BIG Thank You ! to our considerate teachers who were very kind <br>
		and moved some deadlines for us. Thank you also to the teachers who were always responsive<br>
		and always gave us advice, or pointers for an upcoming test :)) <33 </p>
