			<h1 class="desc"> -------- About Author ! --------</h1>
			<p class="guts"> Greetings ! I'm Marithe Ianne D. Gonzales, a *struggling* Pisay Scholar from the section 9 - Pinatubo.
			This is supposed to be our Computer Science 3 Project for the Second Quarter, and I guess I passed it late... yet again.
			I'm sorry, Sir T~T<br><br></p>
			
			<p class="guts">
			But anyway, I got motivated to tackle this sensitive subject because of a TV Show I love watching, which is Glee.
			A character there, Quinn Fabray, although not very explored much, has a very messy and problematic household.
			Her father gets to decide and have the last say in everything, and it's quite obvious Quinn's mother is scared of him.<br><br></p>
			
			<p class="guts">
			I admit, my writing skills aren't the best as well as my coding or HTML skills. But this entire experience
			- of writing the essay, editing it and thinking of words to accurately describe what message I was sending to
			whoever would read it - was deep and it challenged me to ask myself hard or puzzling questions.<br><br></p>
			
			<p class="guts">
			And I do hope that, all victims of domestic abuse can either gather enough strength to stand up for themselves,
			or gain supporters who'll no doubt do their best to help in such a particular situation. I really do wish for
			these issues to be more known about, so people will flock and help in whatever way they can and to learn to be wary 
			or alert about the red flags or warning signs of domestic violence.<br><br></p>
			
			<p class="guts">Again, a  v e r y  BIG Thank You ! to our considerate teachers who were very kind 
			and moved some deadlines for us. Thank you also to the teachers who were always responsive
			and always gave us advice, or pointers for an upcoming test :)) <33 <br></p>
